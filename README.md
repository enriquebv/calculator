# Calculator

This is a basic calculator that will allow the user to add, subtract, multiply and divide.

## MVP:

For this first approach, the user can use tab keyboard and enter to navigate or use the mouse. Future updates will allow user to use keyboard to perform whatever operations she/he wants.

## TDD:

This calculator has been built through TDD.

## Vite:

As CRA is no longer been updated, it has been decided to use vite + react template in order to create the app. We have used css to keep the application as simple as possible.

## Set-up:

### Clone this repository

$ git clone https://github.com/inesppino/calculator

### Node version

In order to run the app, please be aware that node `version 16+` is required. If you have nvm in your terminal, use

$ nvm use

and follow the instructions.
